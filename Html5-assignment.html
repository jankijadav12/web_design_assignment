Ans2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage? 

         Video :

         => The <video> element allows us to embed video files into an HTML.

            Ex: <video>
                <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
                </video>

            <src> - This attribute stands for the source, which is very similar to the src attribute used in the image element. 
                    We will add the link to a video file in the src attribute.

            <type> - This is going to be video/mp4 because .mp4 is the format of the video we are using. 


         Audio :

         => The <audio> element is very similar to the video element. 
            
         => We can use the audio element to play an audio file on our web page â€” such as an mp3 file.

            Ex: <audio>
                <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
                </audio>
            
            <src> - This attribute stands for the source, which is very similar to the src attribute used in the image element. 
                    We will add the link to a video file in the src attribute.

            <type> - mp3 is the format of the video we are using.

Ans4. Canvas and SVG tags

         => SVG tag

         The <svg> tag defines a container for SVG graphics. SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
